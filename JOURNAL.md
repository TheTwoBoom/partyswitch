# June 20th: Wrote 1st revision of BOM (excluding power)

I first looked for a fitting switch chip that supported 2.5Gbit and was in stock.  
After looking for a little bit I found this one
![switch-chip](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ada3f5be-8ac4-447d-b369-e6494a72d15c)

Following that, I read the datasheet and I discovered that 2 transceivers were needed for 2.5gbit
![transceivers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21c77b5d-c138-41db-94bc-030f508d163e)

Because I want to keep some compatability with existing ethernet devices, I added 4 RJ-45 ports (two 2.5gbit ports, two 1gbit ports)
![ethernet-connectors](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8d368e1-82cf-49a1-880f-8474144363e4)

Some ethernet specs said I need to use magnetics so I also added them to the BOM (1 per RJ-45 Port, 4 total)
![magnetics](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86499d5c-ed67-4e26-b07b-2c35f4e197eb)

To connect the USB-Devices I added 3 USB-C Ports and USB to Ethernet Converters

# June 22th: Wrote 1st revision of BOM (power management)

I discovered that the USB-C Connectors I previously chose were kind of weird, so I chose this one instead
![usb-port](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/675f4ecf-fb14-4066-9231-04981d3cc018)

Because most components needed 3.3V, I added a buck converter to convert 5V to 3.3V

To protect my design from power surges, I "copied" the methods from this jam for a USB-Hub and added some methods from ChatGPT:

![1M立 Resistors](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/558dc875-2cc7-4d4b-9351-10bd8a96f93d)

I also added an 5.1k立 Resistor to trigger 5V power via USB-C

# June 25th: Began working on the schematic (and changed some parts after reading the datasheets in detail)

After I placed down all the parts, the pins were simply to many (and the BOM to complicated)
So I changed the USB-Ethernet Chip to a simpler 100mbit Version
![usb-to-ethernet](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1d59963-62f7-4c94-86c1-6562d4cb76f3)

Because of requirements of the buck converter, I added following parts:
![330uF Capacitors](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f7fed82-81fe-4bf3-be61-30e446c29dcc)
![470uF Capacitors](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1eeba504-b877-4952-8740-bc509cdcd969)
![10k立 Resistor](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf0f243c-8a61-4d4b-9a3b-945eb5c5ee8f)
![47uH Inductors](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de312c32-829c-4f49-9abe-cf63974d80cd)

I also changed the schottky diode to this one:

Here's a overview of the power sheet of my schematic

# July 15th: Added USB parts and USB-to-Ethernet converter into the design
Now that I've got all my parts in a BOM, I read the datasheet of the USB-to-Ethernet chip and kind of adapted the reference design to my own while keeping my schematic clean.
